Five games are available:

1. **Geometry Bash**: Bash the squares before they get you and watch out for the money boss! Don't like geometry? You will love this one!! :D
2. **Planet X**: You have been transported to Planet X thru a wormhole. Fly thru obstacles and wormholes to get back home! Game design by my kids.
3. **Number Crush**: Great game to train your kids' basic math skill. Answer quickly or get crushed. My son needs to crush 5 to earn 1 minute of screen time and loves doing it daily. :)
4. **Wasp Invasion**: Wasp kaijus have invaded Earth! Luckily, you got your flamethrower with you to save the day. FLAMES ON!!
5. **THE LAST SURVIVOR!!**: Kill the zombies to survive the apocalypse where you are the last survivor. Level up to get machine gun, grenades, and flamethrower!! Game design by my kids.
